# Spirit of Death
You call forth a spirit that embodies death. The spirit manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the {@creature reaper spirit|BMT} stat block. The spirit disappears when it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue the spirit any commands, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
