# Summon Aberration
You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature Aberrant Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin, Slaad, or Star Spawn. The creature resembles an aberration of that kind, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move to avoid danger.
