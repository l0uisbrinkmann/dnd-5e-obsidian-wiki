# Insect Plague
Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||lightly obscured}. The sphere's area is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d10} piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
