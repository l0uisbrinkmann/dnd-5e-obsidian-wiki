# Ambush Prey
You channel primal predatory energies to perfectly conceal your presence in order to surprise your target. You become {@condition invisible} for the spell's duration, granting advantage on all Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks to remain hidden. The invisibility will last for the duration of the spell, however, moving 5 feet or more from your position when you cast the spell will end the effect.
