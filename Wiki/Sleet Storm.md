# Sleet Storm
Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||heavily obscured}, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls {@condition prone}.

If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is {@status concentration||concentrating} on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose {@status concentration}.
