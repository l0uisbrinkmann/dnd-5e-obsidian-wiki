# Earthquake
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Each creature on the ground that is {@status concentration||concentrating} must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's {@status concentration} is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend {@status concentration||concentrating} on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked {@condition prone}.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
