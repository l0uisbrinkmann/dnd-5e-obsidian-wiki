# Druid Grove
You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.

The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.

The entire warded area radiates magic. A {@spell dispel magic} cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.









A constant {@spell gust of wind} in two locations of your choice

{@spell Spike growth} in one location of your choice

{@spell Wind wall} in two locations of your choice

To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of {@spell spike growth} is harmless.
