# Charm Person
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is {@condition charmed} by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The {@condition charmed} creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was {@condition charmed} by you.
