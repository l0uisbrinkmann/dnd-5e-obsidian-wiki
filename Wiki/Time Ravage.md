# Time Ravage
You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 10d12} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved.
