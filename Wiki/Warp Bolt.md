# Warp Bolt
When you cast this spell, you gain one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}. An arcing bolt of octarine lightning strikes a creature within range. If the target has one or more {@adventure contamination levels|DoDk|12}, it is hit automatically. Otherwise, make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 6d6} necrotic damage and gains one {@adventure level of contamination|DoDk|12}.

You can create a new bolt of lightning as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
