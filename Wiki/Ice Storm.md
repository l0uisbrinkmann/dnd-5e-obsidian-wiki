# Ice Storm
A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 2d8} bludgeoning damage and {@damage 4d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
