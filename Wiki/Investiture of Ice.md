Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits:

You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.

You can move across {@quickref difficult terrain||3} created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.

The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.
