# Shatter
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
