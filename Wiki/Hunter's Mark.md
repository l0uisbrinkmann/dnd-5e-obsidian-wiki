# Hunter's Mark
You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra {@damage 1d6} damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.
