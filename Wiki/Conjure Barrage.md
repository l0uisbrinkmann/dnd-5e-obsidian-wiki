# Conjure Barrage
You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
