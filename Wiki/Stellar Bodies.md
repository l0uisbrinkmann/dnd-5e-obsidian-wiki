# Stellar Bodies
You create two small stars that orbit you. They twinkle pleasantly, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on you. The stars protect you. If a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack they must make a Wisdom saving throw or take {@dice 1d8} points of radiant damage for each star orbiting you.

Once per round, on your turn, you may use your action to cause a star to streak towards an enemy, expending it as it explodes in a blinding flash. Make a ranged spell attack against an enemy within 120 feet, dealing {@damage 4d8} points of radiant damage on a hit. The target must then make a Constitution saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until the start of your next turn.

The spell ends when either its duration expires, you fall {@condition unconscious}, or you have expended all of your stars.
